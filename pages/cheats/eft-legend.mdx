**Markdown With React Components**

<Callout emoji="âœ…">
  **MDX** (the library), at its core, transforms MDX (the syntax) to JSX. It
  receives an MDX string and outputs a _JSX string_. It does this by parsing the
  MDX document to a syntax tree and then generates a JSX document from that
  tree.

</div>
