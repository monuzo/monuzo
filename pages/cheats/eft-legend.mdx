import useSWR from 'swr'
function Profile() {
  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher)
  if (error) return <div>failed to load</div>
  if (!data) return <div>loading...</div>
  return <div>hello {data.name}!</div>

> </Callout>
```
Renders:

> </Callout>

Generates:

import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

<div className="p-4 border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-900 rounded mt-6">
**Markdown With React Components**

<Callout emoji="✅">
  **MDX** (the library), at its core, transforms MDX (the syntax) to JSX. It
  receives an MDX string and outputs a _JSX string_. It does this by parsing the
  MDX document to a syntax tree and then generates a JSX document from that
  tree.
